Abstract
Social media has created a new way for individuals to express their thoughts and
opinions. This medium is used by an estimated 2.95 billion people worldwide,
generating a massive platform for ideas to be shared. Sentiment analysis, or opinion
analysis, is the process of retrieving textual information and discerning which emotions
are exhibited by the author. This type of analysis is used in many ways, including:
determining consumers’ perception of a product, service, brand or marketing campaign;
analyzing a company’s brand recognition on any social networking sites; examining
citizen’s opinions on policy changes, government officials, campaigns, etc.
This project will perform sentiment analysis on real tweets harnessed from Twitter. The
social networking service provides programmers with access to their data through its
APIs (application programming interfaces). The primary aim is to provide a method for
analyzing sentiment scores in noisy twitter streams. This is done by classifying
individual tweets as either negative, neutral, or positive. If a large enough collection of
tweets is analyzed, their collective sentiment score can then be used within a
confidence range to state how the user pool feels towards the specific topic.
In our study, we were able to achieve an accuracy of 77.94% on individual tweet
classifications, and a 95% confidence interval of ± 0.05 on aggregated sentiment score
predictions. The best machine learning method was found to be Stochastic Gradient
Descent. This model was then used on live tweets relating to various subject matters to
extract real-time user sentiment.
